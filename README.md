## Overview

Antenne reports what shipped across the Neorgon fleet: launches, features, and
fixes as short news stories, drafted from the fleet's own work logs. Every story
passes through an approval desk before it publishes, so the feed carries what a
human decided was worth telling, not a firehose of commits. The same feed powers
an embeddable strip for the hub's corner popup and an RSS feed.

**Live:** [dispatch.neorgon.com](https://dispatch.neorgon.com/)

## Features

- **News feed** -- stories with kind badges (launch, feature, fix, note), a hero
  slot for the latest, filters, and full-text search
- **Approval desk** -- `desk.html` reads uncommitted drafts from `data/drafts/`,
  lets you edit and approve each one, and writes the merged `data/posts.json`
- **Embed strip** -- `?embed=1&limit=N` renders a compact headline list for
  iframes, with no storage writes and an attribution link back to the full site;
  add `&brand=0` to drop the strip's own masthead when the host chrome already
  names the site (the hub's corner popup does)
- **Chrome toggle** -- the header auto-hides while you read, and `h` hides the
  header and footer entirely
- **Deep links** -- `#p=<story-id>` opens a story directly; RSS at `feed.xml`
- **NEW markers** -- stories newer than your last visit get flagged, remembered
  per browser

## Publishing pipeline

```
/newsroom (Claude Code command)          desk.html (localhost)
  reads fleet git logs, plans,             edit, approve, spike
  registry, harness ledger      ──────▶    each draft
  writes data/drafts/*.json                     │ publish
        (gitignored)                            ▼
                                          data/posts.json  ──▶  make feed
                                          (committed)           feed.xml
```

Drafts never reach the repo; only approved stories do. On the public site,
`data/drafts/` 404s and the desk explains itself.

## Running locally

ES modules require an HTTP server (not `file://`):

```bash
make serve        # http://localhost:8873
make feed         # validate posts.json, regenerate feed.xml, stamp the feed into index.html
make check        # fail if the stamped feed is stale against posts.json
make drafts-clean # delete consumed drafts
```
